	<h1>INFINITE MARIO balancing test</h1>

	<p>Below are links that lead to batches of <em>Infinite Mario</em> featuring different boredom/stress levels (game balancing).</p>
	<p>Each batch has 3 games. You can jump to the next game of any batch by clicking the green <strong>CONCLUDE</strong> button at the bottom of the game page.</p>

	<ul>
		<li><a href="../experiment/?user=1&debug=1&rest=0.05&sorting=0" target="_blank">Batch 1 - boring</a>: games A1 (extremely boring), B2 (a bit less boring than A1) and C3 (a bit less boring than B2). Subjects should perceive those games as boring.</li>
		<li><a href="../experiment/?user=1&debug=1&rest=0.05&sorting=1" target="_blank">Batch 2 - "ideal"</a>: games K11 (hopefully not boring nor stressful), L12 (a bit more challenging than K11) and M13 (a bit more challenging than L12). Subjects should perceive those games as "enjoyable". The games ideally should not be perceived as boring nor stressful.</li>
		<li><a href="../experiment/?user=1&debug=1&rest=0.05&sorting=2" target="_blank">Batch 3 - stressful</a>: games T20 (extremely stressful), S19 (a bit less stressful than T20) and R18 (a bit less stressful than S19). Subjects should perceive those games as stressful.</li>
		<li><a href="../experiment/?user=1&debug=1&rest=0.05&sorting=3" target="_blank">Batch 4 - all games from boring to stressful</a>: games A1 (extremely boring) to T20 (extremely stressful). This batch gives a better contextualized way of measuring the increase of boredom/stress throughout the games.</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>P.S.</strong> While playing any game, on top of the screen, the game HUD will show the "World name", e.g. "A1". This is a boredom to stress scale that goes as <code>A1, B2, C3, D4, ..., T20</code>. The higher the number, the more stressful the game should feel.</p>
