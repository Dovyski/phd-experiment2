	<h1>INFINITE MARIO balancing test - Revision 2</h1>

	<p>Below are links that lead to batches of <em>Infinite Mario</em> featuring different boredom/stress levels (game balancing).</p>
	<p>Each batch has 3 games. You can jump to the next game of any batch by clicking the green <strong>CONCLUDE</strong> button at the bottom of the game page.</p>

	<ul>
		<li><a href="../experiment/?user=1&debug=1&rest=0.05&sorting=0" target="_blank">Batch 1</a>: games A1 (easy, not necessarily boring), A2 (a bit more challenging than A1) and A3 (a bit more challenging than A1 and A2, expected to be somewhat stressful).</li>
		<li><a href="../experiment/?user=1&debug=1&rest=0.05&sorting=1" target="_blank">Batch 2</a>: games B1 (auto-scrolling and extremelly easy, designed to be boring), B2 (more challenging than A2) and B3 (a bit more challenging than A3, expected to be somewhat stressful).</li>
		<li><a href="../experiment/?user=1&debug=1&rest=0.05&sorting=2" target="_blank">Batch 3</a>: games C1 (easy, not necessarily boring), C2 (more challenging than A2, B2) and C3 (a bit more challenging than A3 and B3, expected to be somewhat stressful).</li>
		<li><a href="../experiment/?user=1&debug=1&rest=0.05&sorting=3" target="_blank">Batch 4</a>: all games from A to C. This batch gives a better contextualized way of measuring the increase of boredom/stress throughout the games.</li>
